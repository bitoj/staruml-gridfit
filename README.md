GridFit extension
====================

This is a StarUML 3+ extension for aligning non-parasitic nodes ("boxes") in diagrams to the grid.

The current version is only a proof of concept, limited to changing the size without moving nodes to the grid. 
Also lacking is a check whether nodes are actually resizable.
